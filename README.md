# symfony-virtualenv

Virtual environment for Symfony (https://symfony.com/download) to make it easy to run `php` and `composer` without adding `symfony` before each command, i.e. you can use

```sh
vendor/bin/drush
```

rather than
```sh
symfony php vendor/bin/drush
```

Usage:

```sh
# Activate by sourcing (don't run the script)
source activate
# Run your commands.
â€¦
# Deactivate the virtual environment.
deactivate
```
